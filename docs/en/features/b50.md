# Score System

The Best 50 (b50) and Best 100 (b100) charts are JiETNG's flagship features, displaying your highest-rated scores in beautifully designed visualizations.

## What is Best 50?

The "Best 50" system is Maimai DX's official ranking method, consisting of:

- **Best 35**: Your top 35 scores from **old version songs (旧曲 - songs from previous versions)**
- **Best 15**: Your top 15 scores from **current version songs (新曲 - songs from the current version)**

Your **Maimai DX Rating** is the sum of these 50 scores.

## Understanding the Output

### Rating Calculation

Each song's rating is calculated as:

```
Base Rating = Internal Level × 10
Achievement Modifier = Based on your achievement %

Final Rating = Base Rating + Achievement Modifier
```

Achievement modifiers:
- **100.5000%+**: +2.0 rating (SSS+)
- **100.0000%**: +1.5 rating (SSS)
- **99.5000%+**: +1.0 rating (SS+)
- **99.0000%+**: +0.5 rating (SS)
- **98.0000%+**: +0.0 rating (S+)
- **97.0000%+**: -1.0 rating (S)
- Below 97%: Lower ratings

### Color Coding

Charts use colors to indicate performance:
- 🟣 **Purple**: SSS+ (100.5%+)
- 🔴 **Red**: SSS/SS+ (99.5-100.49%)
- 🟠 **Orange**: SS/S+ (98-99.49%)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: S (97-97.99%)
- ⚪ **Gray**: Below S

## Tips & Tricks

### Maximizing Your Rating

1. **Focus on高内部值 songs**: Level 14.9, 15.0 charts
2. **Improve SSS → SSS+**: +0.5 rating per song
3. **Bring SS+ → SSS**: +0.5 rating gain
4. **Replace low-rating b50 songs**: Check b100 for opportunities

### Finding Improvement Targets

Use filters to find specific goals:

```
b100 -scr 99.5 100.49    # Find SSS songs to SSS+
b100 -lv 15              # See all your level 15 plays
```

Compare b50 vs ab50 to see type imbalance:

```
b50     # Official rating
ab50    # Best overall scores
```

If your ab50 is much higher, focus on the underrepresented song version.

## Common Questions

### Why is my rating different from in-game?

- JiETNG updates only when you run `maimai update`
- Official rating updates after each play
- Sync your scores regularly to stay current

### Some scores are missing?

Make sure you've played the songs recently. Older scores may not appear if:
- They've been replaced by better scores
- The song was removed from the game
- Data sync issues (try `maimai update` again)

### Can I see historical b50?

Currently, JiETNG shows your current b50. Historical tracking is planned for future updates.
